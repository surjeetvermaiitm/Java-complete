# Challenge â€“ Part 2

There is an imbalance in the `course_student` relationship.

## Launch the Starter Project

## Task 1

Make 4 `PUT` requests:

```
localhost:8080/course/1/student/1
localhost:8080/course/5/student/1

localhost:8080/course/1/student/2
localhost:8080/course/6/student/2

```

## Task 2

Delete the course with an ID of 5. It gets deleted in the course table.

Because `course` owns the association, associated records are deleted in the join table as well.

Now, try deleting the student with an id of 2.
```json
{
    "timestamp": "08-08-2022 07:19:05",
    "message": [
        "Data Integrity Violation: we cannot process your request."
    ]
}
```
Ideally, deleting a student would also remove associated records in the join table.

But `student` is the non-owning side of the association, and cannot make changes to the join table.

## Task 3

In order for `student` to be equal in managing the relationship, you need to:

1. Remove `mappedBy`.
2. Make sure that `student` **owns** the join table as well. 
```java
    @JoinTable(
        name = "course_student",
        joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id", referencedColumnName = "id"),
        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "course_id", referencedColumnName = "id")
    )
```

## Task 4

Make 2 `PUT` requests:

```
localhost:8080/course/1/student/1
localhost:8080/course/1/student/2
```

Then delete the student with an id of 2.

## Good Luck!
