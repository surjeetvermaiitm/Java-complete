# Challenge

The code is getting messy. In this challenge, you will refactor it.

## Task 1

Place the datastore and every CRUD operation inside the `Repository` layer.


## Task 2
-  Place business and decision-making logic inside the `Service` layer. 
-  Make the `Service` layer the middleman. Because the `Service` layer handles the business logic, it should make calls to the `Repository`. 
 
## Task 3

Make sure the controller's only concern is managing the model and presenting the view.

## Task 4
Run your code to make sure everything still works. 

## Good Luck!
