DTO, or Data Transfer Object, is a design pattern used to transfer data between software application subsystems. DTOs are often used in network applications, and they have several advantages and reasons for use, especially when compared to directly using model objects for API calls. Here's a breakdown of what DTOs are and why they are preferred over model objects in certain scenarios:

### What is DTO?

1. **Simplified Object**: DTOs are simple objects that should not contain any business logic. They are used to transfer data between layers and modules of an application.

2. **Customized Data Structure**: They enable you to create a data structure that is optimized for your client-server communication. This might include a subset of the model's properties or a combination of several models.

3. **Decoupling**: DTOs help in decoupling your internal domain model from what you expose externally. This is particularly important for maintaining the flexibility to change the internal model without affecting external interfaces.

### Why Not Use Model Objects Directly for API Calls?

1. **Security and Exposure Risks**: Directly exposing model objects in API calls can inadvertently expose sensitive data or internal implementation details. DTOs allow you to explicitly control what data is exposed.

2. **Tight Coupling**: Using model objects can lead to tight coupling between your internal domain model and the external interface. Any changes in the internal model would directly impact your API consumers.

3. **Over-fetching/Under-fetching**: Model objects might contain more or less information than what the client needs. DTOs can be tailored to provide exactly what is necessary, optimizing both network bandwidth and client processing.

4. **Validation and Complexity**: Model objects often contain complex validation and business logic that are unnecessary and potentially problematic when sending data to or from a client.

5. **Performance Optimization**: DTOs can be optimized for performance in serialization and deserialization, which is crucial in network communication.

6. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: DTOs can be used to apply cross-cutting concerns like logging, error handling, or tracking, which are not part of the domain model logic.

### Conclusion

In summary, while it's technically possible to use model objects for API calls, DTOs offer a more secure, flexible, and efficient way of data transfer in applications, especially those that follow a layered architecture. They provide a clear separation of concerns and allow for better maintainability and scalability of the application.
