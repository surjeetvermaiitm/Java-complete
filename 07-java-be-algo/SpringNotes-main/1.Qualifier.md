The `@Qualifier` annotation in Spring Framework is used to resolve ambiguity when more than one bean of the same type is available in the Spring container. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Purpose**: The primary purpose of `@Qualifier` is to provide a way to distinguish between multiple beans of the same type that have been configured in the Spring context.

2. **Resolving Ambiguities**: When you autowire a bean in Spring (using `@Autowired`), Spring tries to find a bean that matches the required type. If there are multiple beans of that type, Spring needs a way to know which bean you want to inject. This is where `@Qualifier` comes in.

3. **Usage with `@Autowired`**: You typically use `@Qualifier` along with `@Autowired`. While `@Autowired` tells Spring to inject a bean, `@Qualifier` specifies which bean to inject. 

   ```java
   @Autowired
   @Qualifier("specificBeanName")
   private MyService myService;
   ```

   In this example, Spring will inject the bean named `specificBeanName` into `myService`.

4. **Bean Identification**: Beans can be qualified either by their name (the default name is the class name in camelCase) or by a custom name specified via the `@Component("customName")` or `@Service("customName")` annotations.

5. **Use in Constructor Injection**: `@Qualifier` can also be used in constructor-based injection. It's placed next to the constructor parameter to specify which bean should be injected.

   ```java
   @Autowired
   public MyClass(@Qualifier("specificBeanName") MyService myService) {
       this.myService = myService;
   }
   ```

6. **Custom Qualifiers**: Beyond bean names, you can define custom qualifier annotations in Spring. This is useful for further clarifying your intent and making your configuration more type-safe.

7. **Avoiding Ambiguity**: While `@Qualifier` is a powerful tool for resolving ambiguities, it's often better to design your Spring beans in such a way that such ambiguities are minimized. Good design and clear naming conventions can often reduce the need for using `@Qualifier`.

In summary, `@Qualifier` is a critical annotation in Spring for resolving ambiguities when multiple beans of the same type exist. It provides a clear, explicit way of specifying which bean should be injected, thus ensuring the correct wiring of dependencies in your application.
