The `@ExceptionHandler` annotation in Java is a key feature used within the Spring Framework, particularly in the context of Spring MVC for building web applications. It serves a specific purpose in exception handling. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Purpose**: `@ExceptionHandler` is used to handle exceptions that occur within a specific controller class in a Spring MVC application.

2. **Functionality**: When a method in a controller throws an exception, methods annotated with `@ExceptionHandler` can be designed to catch and handle these exceptions. This provides a way to handle exceptions locally within a controller.

3. **Usage**:
   - **Annotation Placement**: It's typically used to annotate a method within a controller class.
   - **Method Definition**: The method annotated with `@ExceptionHandler` will have parameters that match the type of exception it is meant to handle.
   - **Response Customization**: The method can return a view, such as an error page, or a ResponseEntity object, allowing you to customize the HTTP response based on the exception.

4. **Handling Specific Exceptions**: You can specify which exception type the method should handle. This is done by passing the exception class as a parameter to the `@ExceptionHandler` annotation.

5. **Global Exception Handling**: For handling exceptions across multiple controllers, Spring provides the `@ControllerAdvice` annotation, which allows you to write a global exception handler.

6. **Example**:
   ```java
   @Controller
   public class MyController {

       @ExceptionHandler(value = { NullPointerException.class })
       public String handleNullPointerException(NullPointerException e) {
           // Handle the exception and return the view name
           return "error/nullPointerError";
       }
   }
   ```

In this example, if a `NullPointerException` occurs in any of the request-handling methods in `MyController`, the `handleNullPointerException` method will be invoked to handle it, and it will return a view named `error/nullPointerError`.

Using `@ExceptionHandler` is a powerful way to manage exceptions at the controller level, allowing for cleaner error handling and improved user experience in web applications.
