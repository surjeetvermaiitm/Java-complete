The error message you're encountering indicates that Spring is unable to find a suitable `ProductService` bean to inject into your `ProductController`. This could be due to several reasons. Let's address the specific error and provide a solution.

### Understanding the Error

1. **Bean Not Found**: Spring is telling you that it can't find a bean of type `ProductService` that matches the qualifications you've specified.

2. **Qualifier Issue**: The use of `@Qualifier` with SpEL expression `#{...}` in your constructor is not correct. Spring does not support dynamic resolution of `@Qualifier` values through SpEL in this way. 

3. **Candidates Found But Not Injected**: This suggests that there are `ProductService` beans available, but none of them match the qualifier criteria you've set.

### Solution

To resolve this, you need a mechanism that allows dynamic selection of the `ProductService` implementation based on a configuration property. Since dynamic qualifiers aren't directly supported, you'll need to manually select the appropriate bean.

**Option 1: Using ApplicationContext**

One approach is to inject the `ApplicationContext` and use it to get the bean by name, which you can derive from the property value.

```java
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/products")
public class ProductController {

    private final ApplicationContext context;
    private final String productServiceType;

    @Autowired
    public ProductController(ApplicationContext context, 
                             @Value("${ProductService.type}") String productServiceType) {
        this.context = context;
        this.productServiceType = productServiceType;
    }

    private ProductService getProductService() {
        return context.getBean(productServiceType, ProductService.class);
    }

    // ... Rest of the controller
}
```

**Option 2: Using a Map of Services**

Another approach is to autowire a map of service beans, as I previously explained, and then select the appropriate service based on the property value.

```java
import java.util.Map;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/products")
public class ProductController {

    private final Map<String, ProductService> services;
    private final String productServiceType;

    @Autowired
    public ProductController(Map<String, ProductService> services,
                             @Value("${ProductService.type}") String productServiceType) {
        this.services = services;
        this.productServiceType = productServiceType;
    }

    private ProductService getProductService() {
        return services.getOrDefault(productServiceType, defaultProductService());
    }

    // ... Rest of the controller
}
```

Both of these methods allow for dynamic selection of the `ProductService` bean based on the value of a configuration property. Choose the one that best fits your application's design and complexity.

**Option 3: Using a Factory Pattern**

Using a factory to dynamically select a `ProductService` implementation based on a configuration property is a clean and maintainable approach. Let's create a `ProductServiceFactory` that will handle the logic of selecting the appropriate `ProductService` implementation. 

First, define your `ProductService` interface and its implementations. Each implementation should be a Spring-managed bean, potentially with a unique identifier if you're using the Qualifier annotation.

### Step 1: Create the Factory

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import java.util.Map;

@Component
public class ProductServiceFactory {

    private final Map<String, ProductService> services;

    @Autowired
    public ProductServiceFactory(Map<String, ProductService> services) {
        this.services = services;
    }

    public ProductService getProductService(String type) {
        ProductService service = services.get(type);
        if (service == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("No ProductService found for type: " + type);
        }
        return service;
    }
}
```

In this factory, we are autowiring a map of `ProductService` implementations. The key of the map is the bean name, and the value is the bean itself. The `getProductService` method takes a type (which will be the bean name) and returns the appropriate `ProductService` instance.

### Step 2: Modify the Controller to Use the Factory

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/products")
public class ProductController {

    private final ProductServiceFactory productServiceFactory;
    private final String productServiceType;

    @Autowired
    public ProductController(ProductServiceFactory productServiceFactory, 
                             @Value("${ProductService.type}") String productServiceType) {
        this.productServiceFactory = productServiceFactory;
        this.productServiceType = productServiceType;
    }

    private ProductService getProductService() {
        return productServiceFactory.getProductService(productServiceType);
    }

    @GetMapping
    public String getProducts() {
        ProductService productService = getProductService();
        // Use productService for business logic
        return "Received a request for products";
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public String getProductById(@PathVariable("id") Long id) {
        ProductService productService = getProductService();
        // Use productService for business logic
        return "Received a request for a product with id: " + id;
    }

    // ... Other methods
}
```

In the `ProductController`, the `ProductServiceFactory` is autowired, and we use the factory to get the correct `ProductService` instance based on the `productServiceType` property value. This approach abstracts the complexity of bean selection and makes the controller code cleaner and more maintainable.
